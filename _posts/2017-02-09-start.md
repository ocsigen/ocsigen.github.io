The Ocsigen team is very happy to announce the first release of two
major new projects:

- [Ocsigen Start][os]: a Web/mobile application skeleton written with
  Js\_of\_ocaml and Eliom. You can use this skeleton as a basis for
  your own app, or to learn Web/mobile app development in OCaml.

- [Ocsigen Toolkit][ot]: a set of responsive widgets for your mobile
  and Web applications in OCaml.

Both projects are available via [OPAM][opam] and released under the
LGPL.

Before installing, you can try out a demo of Ocsigen Start. The demo
is available

- [on the Web][osdemo];
- via the [Google Play store][googleplay];
- as an Android [APK file][apk]; and
- as an [iOS application][ios] to be installed via XCode.

Ocsigen Start provides the basic features for user management
(registration, activation links, password recovery, etc.), and some
useful libraries.  Remove the parts you don't need for your own app.

Ocsigen Start also contains many examples of code: remote procedure
calls, push notifications from the server, reactive pages, database
interaction, session data, internationalization, and some widgets from
Ocsigen Toolkit.

Ocsigen Toolkit contains common widgets for mobile and Web apps,
written natively in OCaml and specifically designed for Eliom's
multi-tier and multi-platform programming style.  You can also use
them in client-only Js\_of\_ocaml programs.  Many new widgets will be
added in future versions.

Ocsigen Start and Ocsigen Toolkit are developed by the Ocsigen team at
[Be Sport][besport], at the [Paris Diderot University][p7], and at the
[IRILL][irill].
