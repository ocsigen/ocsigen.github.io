# Ocsigen Web site

The Web site content lives in a [Git repository][repo], 
and gets served by means of the [GitHub Pages][githubpages] infrastructure.

## Pages
Pages are generated by html_of_wiki, from the wiki documentation in each project.
Any change in html files here will be overwritten. The wikis are in the `manual`
directory.

* `make local` --- generates the website with links supporting local navigation. (*For testing only!*)
* `make website` --- generates the files to upload on GitHub Pages.
* `make commit` --- `make website` + `git add` the files + `git commit -v` (opens your `$EDITOR` for editing commit message).
* `make deploy` --- `make commit` + `git push origin master`.
* `make open` --- opens `index.html` in your default web browser.

The content of the website is not refreshed automatically.
**On each modification/addition of a .wiki file, you have to** `make deploy`.

## Blog
